ESILV A4 Research track : "A Quantum model for constrained markowitz modern portoflio using slack variable to process mixed binary optimization under QAOA"
## Introduction 
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our groundbreaking article on leveraging quantum computing techniques to optimize constrained Markowitz modern portfolios. In this repository, you'll find all the necessary code and resources related to our research, aiming to revolutionize portfolio optimization methodologies.

Our article introduces a novel approach that combines principles from quantum computing with Markowitz portfolio theory to address the challenges of constrained portfolio optimization. By employing Slack variables and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), we offer a sophisticated solution capable of handling mixed binary optimization problems efficiently.

Within this repository, you'll discover:

- Implementation code for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA).
- Tools and utilities for processing constrained Markowitz portfolio optimization.
- Data sets and examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.
- Documentation to guide you through the implementation and utilization of our approach.
  
We encourage collaboration and feedback from the quantum computing and financial optimization communities. Together, let's explore the exciting possibilities at the intersection of quantum computing and modern portfolio theory. Dive into the code, experiment with our methods, and join us on the journey towards advancing portfolio optimization in the quantum era.
